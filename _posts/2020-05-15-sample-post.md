Asia remains the growth champion of the world but there’s a large grey cloud on the horizon. Asia is fast getting old and the harsh reality is that it could do so before it gets rich. Asia is on the way to become the “oldest” continent in just a few decades, with the number of people aged over 65 expected to rise from currently 300mn to close to 900mn by 2050. The world is slowly following the fate of Japan, whose elderly population estimates are expected to reach 40% by 2050.  This demographic cliff has also proliferated to European countries such as Germany and France.    

At present, India has the world’s largest youth population that will also turn old in the next 30 years. India is practically sitting on a demographic time bomb where by in 2050, 1 in 5 people will be above the age of 60.

However, as India ages, we are heading for a geographical population divide with the southern states ageing faster than the northern states.

This major north-south divide causes a burden on the ageing southern states. The elderly are hugely dependent and this leads to high demand for accessible healthcare infrastructure, increased financial stability and improved social constructions. This skewed geographical difference in literacy rates and investments in healthcare and education across the Indian peninsula has led to an asymmetric income distribution with the south having a higher per capita income than the north, coupled with decreased fertility rates and prolonged life expectancy in the South.

**Women more Vulnerable**

What’s also important to note is the feminization of the elderly in the south, with similar patterns observed in Japan and some provinces in China. Women continue to bear the brunt even in old age living lonely longer lives lacking access to basic services. The prevention of ownership of assets for women due to traditional social structures, adds to their economic independence woes. 

**An honest Day’s work** 

The aged today is still employed contributing to 5% of India’s working population with a majority of them living in rural areas with low income jobs which are highly insecure. Nearly 90% are informal sector dependent and those drawing pensions from organized sector forms a meagre 10%. More traumatic data is that 18% of males and 3% of females work beyond the age of 80 indicating that poverty is an important reason for elderly work participation.  

**Breakdown of Social Structures**

The gradual disintegration of the archaic joint family system in India and transition into nuclear families often leaves the elderly behind to fend for themselves.

#### What Next?

It is important that the socioeconomic consequences of India’s ageing and declining population is assessed so that new ways can be found to accommodate them. India requires a well-developed healthcare system and this is one sector which has inadequate infrastructure and services as realised with the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare in India is unequal, with the poorer and often elderly population succumbing to this trap. Immediate strengthening of primary health centres and sensitization towards the need for intensive geriatric care which can be managed by the involvement of public and private institutions catering to all. 

Understanding of societal and family structural changes in India along with growing economic and geopolitical changes in the country must be integrated to understand the multitude of sectors that affect the aged. 

Migration of younger working age is inevitable to replace the ageing population as seen with immigration policies in Japan. In Japan, graduates with multiple offers are now hiring specialists to reject would be employers. Unlike their peers in many other countries, they are deluged with job offers and have no idea how to deal with it. India will see a greater multitude of migration from the northern to southern region adding to the already collapsing migrant workers crisis which it must first reinforce. 

Mental well being of the elderly is another concern as half of the older persons carry some form of psychological distress. Mental health status worsened with advancing age and were higher for women who were also poor and uneducated.

#### In Conclusion 

Asia’s wrinkles have started to show. Asia’s expected ‘grey tsunami’ should not be an excuse not to act, but rather seen as a call to action. Several countries have made progress in improving social protection and care for elderly. India must combat this concern with equal vigour and preparedness to be ready to face the Grey Tsunami.

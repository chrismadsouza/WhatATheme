A week of stuffing ourselves with dhoklas and jalebis, to taking a short siesta at the white dessert, <br>
 Gujarat is truly a melting point of picturesque culture, clothing, food, and music.  <br>

<br>
 One fine day, Usha, and I, randomly (like always) decided to go backpacking to Gujarat for a week. Having a rough itinerary ready we did not anticipate the soulful and adventurous experience that we would be embarking. 
<br>
Touring the city only on local buses and trains, Gujarat’s reputation of excellent roads exceeds itself. With exceptional connectivity across the state, bus journeys are a souvenir of changing traditional attire and identities of people across boundaries. On one such journey Usha noticed on how baldness is never a problem in Gujarati genes and for the rest of the trip, we went on to observe the same. Gujrati cuisine is very diverse but slightly leans on to the sweeter palate, which worked wonderfully for me. In fact, we had the best mutton chaap of our lives in Ahmedabad.

Our first stop was the majestic wonders of Champagner- Pavagadh, a beautiful blend of Hindu and Islamic legacies. Not a fan of huge crowds, these monuments were perfect in serenity. We were transported back in time of the Rajputs and the Mughals. The famous 100-ruppee note monument aka Rani ki wav step-well, build by the Rani herself, stands out as one of the most magnificent stepwells which was buried for nearly 7 centuries! Similarly, the Modhera sun temple commands respect out of an individual.

As we are complete wildlife buffs, there was no way we could have missed the Gir National Park. Those who relate to us, know the absolute tranquillity of being in the jungle for a couple of hours in silence. It’s almost like therapy! And of course, to be rewarded by the sight of a lioness roaring? Nothing like it.

Next, we moved to Kutch, India’s largest district and well, a place of its own. Kutch has many unexplored places like Kaliya dhrow and Khari nadi gorge (canyon) which are rock formations sculpted by wind and water in colours of crimson. Kutch noticeable stands out from the rest of Gujarat by flaunting a rainbow palette of clothes, Kutchi thalis and houses thriving in the saline wilderness. As you become one with the vastness of the great Rann, the white desert almost commands devotionality out of an individual. The human eye reaches as far as it can, to see the sky and land meet. It is a summit-like humbling yet emotional experience. 

<br>
For the last leg of our trip, there was no better place to end, than the city of Ahmedabad. The heritage walk (100% recommended) is a 2km walk through escape exits and tunnels hidden in plain site in the old city of King Ahmed Shah (from where Ahmedabad gets its name). Known as the mandir to masjid journey, it takes one through numerous pols (housing clusters) and chowks. Here, it undoubtedly feels like the past and the present are two brothers, raising a toast to each other.

<br>
#### Final thoughts

Two women backpacking does ignite curiosity in most places of India and likewise Gujarat. What strikes out here is that women freely move about, even at night, so one feels very safe. In fact, there were days where we were quite stranded in remote villages because we missed the last bus but felt very secure. For those looking to explore the state, the Gujarat tourism website(link) Is an excellent source of information and is very well planned to cater to a tourist’s needs. In the end, we returned content, with salt all over our clothes, dhoklas in our bellies and memories in our hearts. 

<br>
Oh, we’ll definitely be back to 'Breathe in a bit of Gujarat'!
